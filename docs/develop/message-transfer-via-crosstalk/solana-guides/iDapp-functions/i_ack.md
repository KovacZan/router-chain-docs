title: i_ack
sidebar_position: 4
---

After the `i_receive` function is executed, an acknowledgment is generated by Router's destination chain Gateway contract, indicating whether the call was successful. The i_ack function must be implemented in your contract with the following structure:

```rust
pub fn i_ack(
    ctx: Context<IAck>,
    request_identifier: u128,
    exec_flag: bool,
) -> Result<Vec<u8>>
```

#### Parameters:
* `request_identifier`: This is the same nonce received when calling the `i_send` function on the source chain's Gateway contract. It helps map the acknowledgment to the corresponding request.
* `src_chain_id`: A boolean value indicating the execution status of the request on the destination chain.

#### Account Context
```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct IAck<'info> {
    //CHECK: dapp can have different storage structure, dapp have to validate account
    #[account(mut)]
    pub dapp_account: UncheckedAccount<'info>,
    #[account()]
    pub packet_account: AccountLoader<'info, PacketAccount>,
    #[account()]
    pub gateway_authority: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

#### Account Info:
* `packet_account`: Contains the exec data which is the data in bytes that provides the abi-encoded return value from the `i_receive` call on the destination chain. Based on the application's requirement, this data can be decoded and processed on the source chain.
* `gateway_authority`: The authorized signer by the Gateway contract to ensure the request is valid.

:::caution
Currently, `i_ack` does not support dynamically passing additional accounts beyond those explicitly listed in the IAck context.
